This is a cheatsheet of math symbols. This to keep track of all symbols discussed during statistics classes. The list is in no means complete, but reflects the symbols used in data science and machine learning.

| Symbol    | Description                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| $\alpha$  | Alpha coefficient                  |
| $\bar{x}$ | Mean of variable $x$               |
| $\beta$   | Beta coefficient                   |
| $\hat{x}$ | Estimated value of $x$             |
| $\in$     | Is an element of                   |
| $\int$    | Integral                           |
| $\mu$     | Mean                               |
| $\prod$   | Product                            |
| $\rho$    | Correlation                        |
| $\sigma$  | Standard deviation                 |
| $\subset$ | Is a subset of                     |
| $\sum$    | Sum                                |
| $d$       | Differential                       |
| $p_A$     | Probability of event $A$           |
| $p$       | Probability                        |
| $s$       | Sample standard deviation          |
| $x_i$     | Value of variable $x$ at index $i$ |
| $X$       | Stochastic variable                |
| $x$       | Variable (fixed value)             |

Over time the list will be expanded and perhaps ordererd in a more logical way.
