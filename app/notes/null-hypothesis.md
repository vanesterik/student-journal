A Null Hypothesis is a statement that there is no relationship between two variables. It is the default position that there is no relationship between two variables. The alternative hypothesis is the opposite of the null hypothesis. It is usually the hypothesis you set out to investigate. The alternative hypothesis is what you hope to prove in your study/experiment.

## Example

Let's say you are interested in the relationship between the amount of coffee a person drinks and their productivity at work. You could set up a null hypothesis like this:

> There is no relationship between the amount of coffee a person drinks and their productivity at work.

The alternative hypothesis would be:

> There is a relationship between the amount of coffee a person drinks and their productivity at work.

You can test the null hypothesis by measuring the variables in your experiment. If you get a [[p-value]] that is less than your significance level, you reject the null hypothesis. If your p-value is greater than your significance level, you fail to reject the null hypothesis.
