The t-statistic is a measure of how well the model fits the data. It is calculated as the ratio of the estimated coefficient to the standard error of the estimated coefficient. The estimated coefficient is the coefficient that is estimated by the model. The standard error of the estimated coefficient is the standard deviation of the estimated coefficient. The t-statistic is calculated as:

$$
t = \frac{\text{estimated coefficient}}{\text{standard error of the estimated coefficient}}
$$

The t-statistic is related to the [[F-statistic]] and the [[P-Value]] and is rooted in the [[Students t distribution]].
