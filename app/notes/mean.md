The mean is the average of the numbers. It is easy to calculate: add up all the numbers, then divide by how many numbers there are. In other words it is the sum divided by the count. For example, the mean of 3, 5, 7, 3 and 5 is 23/5 = 4.6.
The mathematical symbol for mean is $\mu$ (the Greek letter "mu").

The mathematical equation for mean is:

$$ \mu = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} $$

where $x_i$ is the $i$th element from the sample of $n$ elements.
