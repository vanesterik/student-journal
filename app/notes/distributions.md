Distributions are a way to describe the probability of an event occurring. They are used to describe the probability of a random variable taking on a certain value. There are two types of distributions: discrete and continuous. Discrete distributions are used when the random variable can only take on a finite number of values - ie. counting heads when tossing a coin. Continuous distributions are used when the random variable can take on any value in a range - ie. the height of a person.

We have been discussing the following distributions in class:

- [Beta Distribution](/notes/beta-distribution)
- [Bernoulli Distribution](/notes/bernoulli-distribution)
- [Binomial Distribution](/notes/binomial-distribution)
- [Normal Distribution](/notes/normal-distribution)
- [Poisson Distribution](/notes/poisson-distribution)
- [Student's t Distribution](/notes/students-t-distribution)
- [Uniform Distribution](/notes/uniform-distribution)

Each distribution in the above list has its respective characteristics and use cases. It is paramount to understand the differences between each distribution and when to use them.
