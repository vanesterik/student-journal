This is a cheatsheet of math symbols. This to keep track of all symbols discussed during statistics classes. The list is in no means complete, but reflects the symbols used in data science and machine learning.

| Symbol    | Description                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| $\alpha$  | Alpha coefficient                  |
| $\beta$   | Beta coefficient                   |
| $\theta$  | Theta coefficient                  |
| $\in$     | Is an element of                   |
| $\subset$ | Is a subset of                     |
| $\rho$    | Correlation                        |
| $d$       | Differential                       |
| $\int$    | Integral                           |
| $\mu$     | Mean                               |
| $\prod$   | Product                            |
| $\sigma$  | Standard deviation                 |
| $\sum$    | Sum                                |
| $p_A$     | Probability of event $A$           |
| $p$       | Probability                        |
| $s$       | Sample standard deviation          |
| $x$       | Variable (fixed value)             |
| $X$       | Stochastic variable                |
| $x_i$     | Value of variable $x$ at index $i$ |
| $\bar{x}$ | Mean of variable $x$               |
| $\hat{x}$ | Estimated value of $x$             |

Over time the list will be expanded and perhaps ordererd in a more logical way.
