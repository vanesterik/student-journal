Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, and is used in different business, science, and social science domains. In today's business world, data analysis plays a role in making decisions more scientific and helping businesses operate more effectively.

Probability [distributions](/notes/distributions) and data analysis are closely related, as distributions are a way to describe the probability of an event occurring. This is important because data analysis is all about understanding the probability of events occurring and how they relate to each other. For example, if you are analyzing a dataset with two variables, you might want to know how likely it is that one variable will change given a change in the other variable.
