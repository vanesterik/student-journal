An A/B test is a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B. It is a way to compare two versions of something to figure out which performs better. A/B tests are very common in online marketing and product development. A/B tests are also known as split tests.

When doing an A/B test you want to make sure that the only difference between the two variants is the one you are testing. Everything else should be the same. This is called controlling for confounding variables. If you don't control for confounding variables you can't be sure that the difference in performance is due to the change you are testing. 

For example, if you are testing a new design for a website you want to make sure that the only difference between the two variants is the design. You don't want to test a new design and a new feature at the same time. If you do, you can't be sure that the difference in performance is due to the design. It could be due to the new feature.
