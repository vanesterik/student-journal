In the realm of statistics, there are many methods that are used to analyze data. This page is a collection of notes on the methods that we have discussed during class.

- [[AB Test]]
- [[Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test]]
- [[L1 Regularization]]
- [[Monte Carlo Method]]
- [[Multi Armed Bandit]]
- [[Permutation Test]]

Quite a lot of thought went in to how to name this group. Other suggestions included "Approuches", "Techniques", "Tools" among other things. I setteld on "Methods" as it is close to the OOP programming paradigm, as in ... if "Statistics" is a class then "Methods" are the functions that can be called on that class.
