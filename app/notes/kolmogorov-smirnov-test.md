The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test is used to compare two datasets (or a dataset to a known distribution) to see if they come from the same underlying probability distribution.

Imagine you've got some data, maybe scores from two different classes. You want to know if the scores from one class are just like the scores from the other class, or if they're really different.

**What's the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test?**

- It's a tool in stats to see if two sets of numbers come from the same source or pattern.
- Think of it as asking, "How likely is it that these scores are from the same test or group?"

**How does it work?**

- The test measures how close the scores are to what you'd expect if they were from the same source.
- It's named after two smart people, Andrey Kolmogorov and Nikolai Smirnov.

**One-sample vs. Two-sample:**

- If you're comparing one set of scores to a known pattern (like scores from past years), it's called a one-sample test.
- If you're comparing scores from two different sets, that's a two-sample test.

**Goodness of Fit:**

- The test can also check if your data fits a specific pattern, like a normal distribution (bell curve).
- But there are other tests, like the Shapiro–Wilk test, that might be better for some situations.

**Final Thought:**

- The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test is handy, but it's not always the best tool for every job. Depending on your data, other tests might give you clearer answers.

So, in a nutshell, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test helps with statistics if two sets of data are really similar or if they're quite different.
