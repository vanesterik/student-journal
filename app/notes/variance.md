Variance is a measure of how spread out a data set is. It is calculated as the average squared deviation from the mean. The variance is always positive. A variance of zero means all the data points are the same. The variance is not easy to interpret.

The [[standard deviation]] is a normalized version of the variance that is easier to interpret. The standard deviation is always positive. A standard deviation of zero means all the data points are the same. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The standard deviation is the most commonly used measure of spread.

$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \mu)^2}{n}
$$

where $\mu$ is the mean of the data set.
