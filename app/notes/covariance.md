Covariance is a measure of how much two random variables change together. It is calculated as the average of the product of the deviations of each data point from the mean. It is a measure of linear dependence between two variables. If the variables are independent, the covariance is zero. If the covariance is positive, the variables are positively correlated. If the covariance is negative, the variables are negatively correlated. The magnitude of the covariance is not easy to interpret.

The [[correlation coefficient]] is a normalized version of the covariance that is easier to interpret. The correlation coefficient is always between -1 and 1. A correlation coefficient of 1 means the variables are perfectly positively correlated. A correlation coefficient of -1 means the variables are perfectly negatively correlated. A correlation coefficient of 0 means the variables are not correlated.

$$
\rho_{X,Y} = \frac{\sigma_{X,Y}}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}
$$

where $\sigma_{X,Y}$ is the covariance of $X$ and $Y$, $\sigma_X$ is the standard deviation of $X$, and $\sigma_Y$ is the standard deviation of $Y$.
