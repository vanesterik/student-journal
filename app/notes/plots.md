Plots are a great way to visualize data. Below a collection of plots that were discussed during [[statistics]] classes and are useful in data science and machine learning:

- [[Barplot]]
- [[Boxplot]]
- [[Heatmap]]
- [[Histogram]]
- [[Lineplot]]
- [[QQ Plot]]
- [[Scatterplot]]
- [[Violinplot]]

Each plot has its own use case and can be used to visualize different types of data. For example, a barplot is useful to visualize the distribution of categorical data, while a scatterplot is useful to visualize the relationship between two variables.

It is paramount to understand the different types of plots and when to use them. This will help to better understand data and to communicate findings.
