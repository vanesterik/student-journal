A correlation coefficient is a number that helps us understand how two things are related in a set of data. It tells us if there's a connection between two variables, like if one goes up, does the other also go up or down. There are different types of correlation coefficients, each with its own rules and characteristics.

These numbers always fall between -1 and +1. If the correlation is close to +1 or -1, it means there's a strong connection, while a correlation near 0 means there's no clear relationship. However, these numbers have some challenges. Outliers (unusual data points) can mess with the results, and it's important to note that just because two things are correlated doesn't mean one causes the other.
