The standard deviation is a normalized version of the [[variance]] that is easier to interpret. The standard deviation is always positive. A standard deviation of zero means all the data points are the same. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The standard deviation is the most commonly used measure of spread. 

The standard deviation is calculated as:

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \mu)^2}{n}}
$$

where $\mu$ is the mean of the data set.
