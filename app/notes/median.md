The median is the middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending, list of numbers and can be more descriptive of that data set than the average. The median is sometimes used as opposed to the mean when there are outliers in the sequence that might skew the average of the values. In other words, it is the value that is in the middle of the sorted list.

Consider the story of Bill Gates walking into a bar and suddenly everyone inside is a millionaire, on average. This is because the mean is sensitive to outliers. The median, however, is not sensitive to outliers. The median is the middle value of a data set. To find the median, order the numbers from lowest to highest and find the middle value. If there are an even number of values, find the average of the middle two.

The mathematical symbol for median is $m$.
