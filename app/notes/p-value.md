The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one that was actually observed, assuming that the [[null hypothesis]] is true. The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis.

The p-value is used to determine whether the null hypothesis should be rejected or not. The p-value is compared to the significance level. If the p-value is less than the significance level, the null hypothesis is rejected. If the p-value is greater than the significance level, the null hypothesis is not rejected.

The p-value is calculated using the test statistic and the [[probability distribution]] of the test statistic. The test statistic is calculated using the data from the experiment. The probability distribution of the test statistic is determined by the [[null hypothesis]].
