The F-statistic in the context of linear regression is a measure of how well the model fits the data. It is calculated as the ratio of the explained variance to the unexplained variance. The explained variance is the variance of the dependent variable that is explained by the model. The unexplained variance is the variance of the dependent variable that is not explained by the model. The F-statistic is calculated as:

$$
F = \frac{\text{explained variance}}{\text{unexplained variance}}
$$
