# Student Journal - Koen van Esterik

Welcome to my Student Journal! This repository is a collection of my work and learnings throughout my Master's in Applied Data Science from 2023 to 2025.

## Overview

This journal is a reflection of my journey through the world of data science. It contains notes, code snippets, and projects that I've worked on during my Master's program. The notes cover a wide range of topics, from statistical distributions to data analysis techniques.

## Motivation

I created this journal to document my progress and to share my learnings with others. It is loosely based on the [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/) method of note-taking. I hope that this journal will be a useful resource for others who are interested in data science.

## System Requirements

This project requires Python 3.6 or later and uses [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/latest/) for package management.
